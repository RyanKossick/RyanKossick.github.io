### CPSC 120

* Lab 4

    Lab 4, part 1 was one of my favorite labs because of the inclusion of 
    functions that perform math equations. With so many of the daily tasks 
    I do consist of making notes of the values of things I am working on 
    and then using some form of mathematical process to change those values 
    into more useful forms, being able to construct working code that does 
    such a task is very helpful. This taught me the ways different files call 
    upon each other with the use of functions and how the computer processes 
    values assigned by the programmer.


* Lab 5
    
    Lab 5, part 2 was one of my favorite labs because of the use of data 
    type conversion. I like that this lab helps you get around the 
    shortcomings of the data types. Understanding the limitations of the 
    different data types, it is valuable to be able to translate certain 
    pieces of data you already have in your code without having to 
    completely write out a new separate secondary initialization of a 
    companion data value just to be able to use the other data type.


* Lab 7

   Lab 7, part 1 was one of my favorite labs because of the use of arguments. 
   I like how this lab helped us explore the ways the computer organizes and 
   processes the arguments given in the terminal. It was valuable to learn 
   about the code prompts used to analyze and interact with the arguments 
   from the terminal to perform operations in the body of the code.
